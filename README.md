MystrixFSJI is an application for MatrixOS to turn the Mystrix into controller for Free-style Just Intonation.
The key features to support this goal are use of System Exclusive (SysEx) messages under the MIDI Tuning Standard (MTS) to convey tuning information over MIDI, and a custom-made UI.
Future objectives include transposition of the grid-shaped UI, and easy modulation into other keys using another controller.
